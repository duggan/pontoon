Installation
============

Via pip:

::

    $ pip install pontoon

Pontoon works with Pythons 2.6 through 3.5, and should work on any Linux/BSD with Python support.

It's also possible to use pontoon on Windows, though portions of the configuration command (which make use of Linux CLI tools like OpenSSH) do not work.
